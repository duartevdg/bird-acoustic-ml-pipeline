# MAIN EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION
# -----------------------------
# This is the main YAML file to edit for running experiments with the audio classification pipeline.
# Users can select datasets, preprocessing options, feature extractors, models, and hyperparameters here.
# Alternative options are commented for reference — uncomment or modify as needed.
# More than one value can be selected for each option to run multiple experiments in a single execution.
